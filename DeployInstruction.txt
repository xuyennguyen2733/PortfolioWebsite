1. Make sure the folder of your project is also your git repo. For example, your project folder tree may look like:

   my-website
   |__.git
   |__.gitignore
   |__public
   |__src
      |__app
      |__...

- The recommend method is to create your project, then, cd into the top-level folder, init a git repo, and push it to a remote repo created with the exact same name.

2. GitHub look into the root folder or the docs folder for the index.html file. Make sure you set the target build folder to be either of these (docs is recommended):

- Go to angular.json
- Look for

	{
	   ...,
	   "build": {
	      ...,
	      “options”: {
		 "outputPath": "...",
	      },
	      ...,
	   },
	   ...,
	}
- Change "outputPath": "..." to
	"outputPath": {
	   "base": “docs”,
	   “browser”: “”,
	}

3. Build the project

- In the terminal, run `ng build --base-href /[project-name]/`
- It is *very* important that you have 2 ‘/’ before and after your project name in the command
- Commit and push the built version

4. Set up in GitHub
- Go to your repo
- Navigate Settings->Pages (you will need to set your git repo to public or upgrade your plan)
- Under source, select Deploy from a branch
- Under Branch, select the branch you built and select the folder (root) or docs, whichever your built files are in.
- Save
- Now, if you go to Actions, you’ll see your page being built
- Wait until it finish building, then go to “https://xuyennguyen2733.github.io/[project-name]”

5. Built your updated website
- From now on, when you need to make change to your website and build again, simply build and push the changes to GitHub and your hosted website will be automatically rebuilt
